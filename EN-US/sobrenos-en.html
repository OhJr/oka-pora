        <strong>
          <p>The Paths of Ancestry was born from the desire to connect people to the cultural and spiritual roots of Brazil's indigenous peoples. Our purpose is to promote travel experiences that go beyond tourism. They are genuine encounters with nature, ancestral wisdom, and traditional ways of life that are part of our history.</p>

        <p>We work in partnership with indigenous communities, respecting their customs, territories, and forms of organization. Each itinerary is created with care, ensuring that the experience is authentic, sustainable, and beneficial to the visited villages.</p>

        <p>More than knowing places, we want our visitors to learn, listen, and feel the strength of the cultures that have shaped Brazil for centuries. Each trip is a dive into ancestral wisdom, living stories, and respect for nature.</p>

        <p>Come with us to tread this path of respect, exchange, and learning—a journey that transforms the view of the world and of ourselves.</p></strong>
